Well, unmanaged BEV charging may generate carbon dioxide and other air pollution due to high demand on the grid. That’s why we need managed charging to ensure clean energy as well as keep the price low.\nSmart charging is a type of managed charging, which includes Supplier-Managed Charging, shortened as SMC, and Vehicle-to-Grid, shortened as V2G."

For example, for enrollment cash we have $50 to $300.\nHere is a sample SMC program. You can see the one-time enrollment cash, recurring monthly cash, and how many times per month the charging can be shifted back to normal.\nThe battery thresholds here are well-designed to provide an immediate visual aid of the minimum battery and guaranteed battery. We also used milage instead of percentage to make it more intuitive. The mileage will be shown according to the real values of each participant."

Imagine we want to increase 5% of enrollment for each program. We start from baseline, and increase each feature value individually. Then we can see how much each one needs to be, in order to achieve the 5% enrollment increase. And here are our interpretations:\nTo start with, smaller value indicates higher efficiency, and recurring incentives are more important thant one-time. For example, in SMC, the enrollment cash needs to be $64.7 to achieve a 5% enrollment increase, while for monthly cash, it only needs to be $3.2. So monthly cash is more efficient than enrollment cash. Same is true for the 2 types of cash in V2G.\nAlso, guaranteed threshold is more important in SMC than in V2G, indicating range anxiety. Finally, monetary incentives are valued more in V2G than in SMC. This indicates that BEV owners are willing to leverage their BEVs as a source of income."
